**Java Machine Learning Algorithms for Image Processing**

This project demonstrates the implementation of several classic machine learning algorithms in Java, specifically tailored for image processing tasks. The project covers popular techniques such as K-Means clustering, Error Diffusion, and Self-Organizing Maps (SOM). Each of these algorithms serves different purposes, ranging from image quantization to color reduction and pixel classification, providing a comprehensive toolkit for handling various image-related tasks.

### Algorithms Summary

- **K-Means Clustering**:
  - **Purpose**: Groups similar data points (pixels) into clusters, typically used for image segmentation or color quantization.
  - **Key Steps**:
    - Randomly initialize cluster centroids.
    - Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.
    - Recalculate centroids based on the average of assigned points.
    - Repeat until convergence (no changes in assignments).
  - **Use Case**: Useful for reducing the number of colors in an image by clustering similar colors together.

- **Error Diffusion**:
  - **Purpose**: Converts grayscale images to binary (black and white) images by spreading quantization errors to neighboring pixels, improving visual quality.
  - **Key Steps**:
    - Convert image pixels to grayscale.
    - Apply error diffusion using a predefined matrix (e.g., Floyd-Steinberg).
    - Adjust neighboring pixels based on the quantization error.
  - **Use Case**: Commonly used in printers and displays where binary color representation is required.

- **Self-Organizing Map (SOM)**:
  - **Purpose**: A type of neural network used for unsupervised learning, particularly effective in reducing dimensionality and clustering data.
  - **Key Steps**:
    - Initialize neuron weights randomly.
    - Train neurons by adjusting weights based on input pixel data.
    - Assign pixels to the nearest neuron (cluster).
    - Display the quantized image and neuron colors.
  - **Use Case**: Ideal for image quantization and reducing the number of colors in an image while maintaining the overall visual structure.

### Notes for Using This Project

- **Scalability**: The algorithms are designed for small to medium-sized images. For larger images, consider optimizing the code or processing the image in smaller segments.
- **Customization**: Parameters like the number of clusters in K-Means, learning rates in SOM, and diffusion matrices in Error Diffusion can be adjusted to suit different images and desired outcomes.
- **Applications**: This project can be applied in various fields such as image compression, color quantization for printing, pixel classification, and other image processing tasks where machine learning techniques are beneficial.
- **Dependencies**: Ensure that your Java environment is set up with the necessary libraries for handling images (`java.awt`, `javax.swing`, etc.). Proper image file paths and formats (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`) are required for the algorithms to function correctly.
